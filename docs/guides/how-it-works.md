# How PBI-Scope Works

PBI-Scope orchestrates a full phage-host data pipeline using Snakemake and Docker.

## Data inputs

- **Public phage input**: PhageScope exports
- **Optional private input**: `private_data/<Source_DB>/`
- **Host genome source**: NCBI RefSeq

## Public-data pinning configuration

`workflow/config/config.yaml` includes:

- `public_data_provider.*` (`name`, `release`, `snapshot_date`, `schema_profile`, `api_base_url`, `provenance_mode`)
- `public_data_provenance.*` controls (`require_release_or_snapshot`, checksum/header capture, schema-mismatch behavior, and manifest output paths)

This keeps current `*_urls` maps intact while adding a provider/version foundation for future `phagescope_v1`/`phagescope_v2` transitions.

## Data provenance

During each public file download, PBI-Scope writes a sidecar record with:

- source URL and local path
- retrieval timestamp, file size
- optional checksum (`sha256`) and HTTP headers (`ETag`, `Last-Modified`)
- detected tabular columns + schema fingerprint
- status/error message

Sidecars are consolidated into:

- `pipeline_logs/csv/public_data_manifest.json/.csv`
- `pipeline_logs/csv/pipeline_run_provenance.json/.csv`

These are loaded into DuckDB tables `dataset_provenance` and `pipeline_run_provenance`. Quick checks:

```sql
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM dataset_provenance GROUP BY status;
SELECT provider_release, provider_snapshot_date FROM pipeline_run_provenance;
```

**Private-data diagnostics**: private datasets are validated source-by-source. Only `is_valid: true` sources are ingested. Check `private_data/private_manifest.json` for skipped sources and validation errors.

## Pipeline stages

```text
workflow/Snakefile
   |
   +-- phagescope.smk  -> download public phage metadata/FASTA + provenance manifests
   +-- database.smk    -> merge metadata + build/optimize DuckDB
   +-- sequences.smk   -> build/index phage & protein FASTA
   +-- hosts.smk       -> parse host fields, resolve assemblies, download host FASTA
   +-- gff3.smk        -> download/index phage GFF3 annotations
   +-- blast.smk       -> build BLAST databases (phages, proteins, hosts, private, combined)
```

When private source folders are present, validation and private mapping preparation run automatically before final outputs are finalized.

!!! warning "First run is slow — this is expected"
    Downloading, host resolution, file merging, and BLAST database building are **time-consuming tasks** on the first execution (often 10+ hours). The pipeline may seem stalled — in particular, the `makeblastdb` / BLAST database building step is just long — but it is processing large genomic files. Monitor progress via the Snakemake logs. Subsequent runs reuse cached data and complete significantly faster.

## Main outputs

- `phage_database_optimized.duckdb`
- `all_phages.fasta(.fai)`
- `all_proteins.fasta(.fai)`
- `host_fasta_mapping.json`
- `private_phage_mapping.json` (if private sources exist)
- GFF3 annotations + index (`gff3/`, `gff3_index.json`)
- `blast_db/` — BLAST databases (phages, proteins, hosts, private, combined)
- `public_data_manifest.json/.csv` (public-source provenance)
- `pipeline_run_provenance.json/.csv` (run-level provider pinning)
- reports and logs

## Access model

- **Primary**: `pbi` package in the analysis container
- **REST API**: metadata queries, single sequence retrieval, SQL queries (see [API Reference](../api/overview.md))

## Why host data is handled outside DuckDB

Host genomes are large and variable; they are stored as individual FASTA files and mapped through JSON/CSV link files for efficient retrieval.
